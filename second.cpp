This rock paper scissors game asks the user to authenticate through a password
before allowing them to play.
The computer picks a random number between 1 to 3 and depending on the number the computer will either pick rock/paper/scissors. 
depending on what the user picks and the computer picks, there are three outcomes for both the computer and user: draw/win/lose.
